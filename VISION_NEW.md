# Vision Statements

## Ok, so here is a truly pie in the sky fleshing out of the idea from Claude. my original concept was meant to be somethign manageable that I coudl use for learning. 

The Cross-Game Mechanics Compendium is an excellent choice! This project would create a fascinating resource for game designers, players, and researchers. Let me outline how you could build this using Kafka and multiple data sources:

## Cross-Game Mechanics Compendium Architecture

### Data Collection Layer

**Streaming Sources (via Kafka):**
- **Game API Webhooks** - Direct feeds from games that expose mechanics data
- **Game Update Trackers** - Real-time patch notes and updates that modify mechanics
- **Twitch/YouTube Game Development Streams** - Metadata about design discussions
- **Game Design Forums** - Posts about mechanics (Reddit, GameDev.net, Discord)

**Batch Sources:**
- **Game Wikis/Fandom Pages** - Rich structured data about game mechanics
- **Game Database APIs** (IGDB, GiantBomb) - Core game metadata
- **Academic Game Design Repositories** - Research papers on game mechanics
- **Postmortem Articles** - Designer insights from Gamasutra/Game Developer
- **Game Design Documents** - When publicly available

### Processing Architecture

```
Streaming Sources → Kafka Topics → Kafka Streams → Mechanics Detection Service → MongoDB
                                              ↓
Batch Sources → ETL Pipelines → Data Lake (S3/GCS) → Spark Processing → Data Warehouse
                                                                      ↓
                                            ML Classification → Mechanics Taxonomy → GraphDB
                                                                                  ↓
                                                              API Layer → Frontend Dashboard
```

### Core Components

1. **Mechanics Extraction Engine**
   - NLP processing to identify mechanics descriptions from text
   - Image recognition to identify mechanics from screenshots/videos
   - Pattern matching to identify similar mechanics across games

2. **Mechanics Classification System**
   - Taxonomy builder to categorize and relate mechanics
   - Similarity scoring to measure relationships between mechanics
   - Version tracking to see how mechanics evolve over time

3. **Cross-Reference Engine**
   - Graph database to track influences between games
   - Timeline visualization of mechanics evolution
   - Citation network to track origin and adoption of mechanics

### User-Facing Features

1. **Mechanics Explorer**
   - Searchable database of game mechanics with examples
   - Filters by genre, era, platform, and implementation details
   - Side-by-side comparisons of similar mechanics

2. **Mechanics Genealogy**
   - Visual timeline showing the evolution of mechanics
   - Influence maps showing which games borrowed from others
   - Innovation tracking to identify originators vs refiners

3. **Designer's Workbench**
   - Tools to analyze mechanics implementations
   - Recommendation engine for mechanics combinations
   - Gaps analysis to identify underexplored mechanics areas

### Technical Implementation Notes

- Use Kafka Connect for integrating with various APIs
- Implement schema registry to handle diverse data formats
- Build a custom NLP pipeline for mechanics identification
- Develop a graph database schema to represent relationships between mechanics
- Create a taxonomy management system for consistent classification

This project would provide tremendous value to the game development community while giving you experience with streaming data, batch processing, and advanced analytics in a fascinating domain!

## Realistic goals
I want to get one of those data sources hooked up first, somethign that is free and not too difficult to obtain in terms of oauth and api keys and all that. since I'm going for kafka learning and nlp refresher, let's pick somethign taht I will want to stream in, and then somethign that is unstructured and raw enough that I'll need to have some data cleaning and some NLP techniques applied.
